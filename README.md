# To Do List Application

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for

This project was created with the intention to recreate a to do list. The application will add new items to the a to do list. The application will also filter the data showing incomplete items as well as complete items. Users can also save their current list or open up a previously saved one. This project was created for UCF COP 3330 spring semester


## How To Use

The application has a Textfield at the top which signifies the Title of the current to do list.

The two menu buttons next to the Title are the save and open button. 

Clicking the save button will bring up a screne for you to save the information on the list. The application automatically defaults the data into a txt file

The open button will allow users to load a previously saved list file and load the contents of that file into the GUI

At the bottom of the application the user will be allowed to enter a description for a new task item. The description must be within 1-256 characters or a pop up will appear

The field next to description is where users will set the date. Using the date analog box users will be restricted to dates that are today or in the future. If a date is entered incorrectly the value will be saved as an empty string

The add button will populate the table with items the user has created

The table contains three columns which will display the different aspects of each item. The completed column is a checkBox where users can click if a certain item has been finished

The due date columm will display the date each item must be completed

The last column is the description which will display the description for each item

Each column is sortable by from ascending or descending with a simple click of the column header

The most important aspect of the application is the mini plus bar on the side of description table column

There you will be able to select and display certain columns as well as displaying items which have been completed or yet to be completed
The last menu item on the table is an option to clear the table entirely. A confirmation pop up will display to make sure the user wants to proceed upon clearing the table
